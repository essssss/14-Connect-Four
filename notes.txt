Step One: Planning

Before looking at our code, take a few minutes to think about how you would build a game like this using HTML/JS/CSS:


*** what HTML would be useful for the game board itself?
Maybe a series of divs inside a flexbox?

*** how could you represent a played-piece in the HTML board?
a simple color class for each div. say Red and Blue

*** in the JavaScript, what would be a good structure for the in-memory game board?
An array of arrays, silly.

*** what might the flow of the game be?
each turn will consist of a "piece drop" where the player clicks a column and the piece falls as low in the column as it can. The piece is displayed the proper color. The game will check for a winner and if there is no winner it will switch turns.

***Then, write down some functions names/descriptions that would be useful for this game.

A function that takes a click and places the piece on the lowest possible row. 
checkerDrop()

A function that places the 'checker' in place.
redChecker()
blueChecker()

several functions that check for win conditions. 
--can I do one for all horizontal, one for all vertical, and one for diagonals?
--do I have to check each possible winning position?






Step Two: ES2015

This code would benefit from updating to ES2015 style â€” there are lots of place where var is used that could be changed to either let or const to improve readability. Are there other style fixes you can make?
